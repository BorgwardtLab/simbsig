Welcome to SIMBSIG's documentation!
===================================

**SIMBSIG**, a Python package which provides a scikit-learn-like interface for out-of-core, GPU-enabled similarity searches, principal component analysis, and clustering. Due to the PyTorch backend it is highly modular and particularly tailored to many data types with a particular focus on biobank data analysis.

**SIMBSIG** is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/MikeAdamer/bigsise-private/>`_.
